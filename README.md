# Diffusion
C64 KickC diffusion algorithms.

## Run
Run `diffusion_horizontal.prg` or `diffusion_vertical.prg` in emulator or real machine, thats all.

## Glitches
Random number generator isn't random enough - if you wait a minute or two you will see, that particles are _drifting_ from one edge of screen to another and back.
